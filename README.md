## [Grunt Tasks](http://grunt-tasks.com/ "Grunt")

This is the central github repository which contains all the grunt files as explained in grunt-tasks.com.
[I](http://jaykanakiya.com/ "Jay Kanakiya") have used a simple configutation to sync my blog posts and github repository so that I can git push and change my blog posts at the same time.

Also makes development work easier by only maintaining the Readme at only one place, while also getting the easier publishing of wordpress.
